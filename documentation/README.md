## Introduction

_Do we really need another programming language?_

I've also asked myself that question a million times - but the truth is that there is no perfect programming language - at least not for my needs. My goal with Blossom is to create a language which enables developers to create projects that grow as beautifully as a flower does - hence the name. This is achieved by adhering to certain core principles:

* **Immutability** - Once declared, variables cannot be modified. This ensures predictable states, eliminates race conditions, and enables safe concurrent code.
* **Strong & explicit typing** - Every value must have a clear, compile-time verified type. No implicit type conversions are allowed.
* **Explicit error handling** - Errors must be explicitly handled or propagated. No silent failures or hidden error states.
* **Functional** - Encourages pure functions and immutable data structures for better tests and maintainability.

Blossom compiles to Erlang, inheriting the power and stability of the Erlang VM to deliver exceptional concurrency and fault tolerance within a clean and elegant codebase

## Installation & Playground

Installing Blossom is quite straightforward.

If you're on `MacOS`:

```bash
brew install blossom
```

If you're on `Linux`:

```bash
curl github.com/fhamm/blossom/install.sh | sh
```

If however, you don't want to install Blossom yet but want to give it a try, you can check Blossom's Interactive Playground.
